"Spectrum of soundness"

TODO
---

- investigate performance of morsecode
- converting to typed "not guaranteed to improve performance"
  ... second-system syndrome?

- intro: "sound" => "conventionally sound"

TYPESETTING
- e D A ... more space ... between notions of reduction and their arguments
  - same for fusion reduction
- "flushleft" the typing rules
- arrow types closer together
- lang E looks too much like evaluation contexts

imagine car manufacturer, certified vehicle, consumer buys it and
 starts replacing/modifying the parts. "Just trust me" he tells the car.
after changes maybe runs maybe doesn't, can make any guarantees about how
 it runs?

MT: replace parts of program with "trust me" things in the gamma.
 could be very useful, like z3 or some fast library for fast things.
 what guarantees about "mixed" programs?
