"Spectrum of soundness"

TODO
---
- is the bowtie relation always correct?
- investigate performance of morsecode


TYPESETTING
- redo typing rules, since appendix
- "flushleft" the typing rules
- rename A to R (for "result"?) .. maybe see mason/talcott for ideas

- - -

imagine car manufacturer, certified vehicle, consumer buys it and
 starts replacing/modifying the parts. "Just trust me" he tells the car.
after changes maybe runs maybe doesn't, can make any guarantees about how
 it runs?

or, factory recycling

MT: replace parts of program with "trust me" things in the gamma.
 could be very useful, like z3 or some fast library for fast things.
 what guarantees about "mixed" programs?
