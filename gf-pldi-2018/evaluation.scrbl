@section{Method}

@subsection{How to Evaluate Performance}
Follow the method proposed by @citet[tfgnvf-popl-2016].

Key insights:
@itemlist[
@item{
  focus on the overhead of gradual typing relative to the baseline with no types;
}
@item{
  all configurations equally likely, the promise is any combination of typed
   and untyped code@~cite[svcb-snapl-2015].
}
]

This in mind, will report performance using a certain kind of plot.
See figure for an example.


@subsection{Experimental Setup}

How many programs,
 how run,
 any other details.


@section{Results}

Its pretty good.
Watch for fully-typed.


@section{Threats to Validity}

Early prototype?
Don't know.
